== Description ==
This plugin currently requires Paid Memberships Pro. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-user-pages` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Edit the PMPROUP_PARENT_PAGE_ID constant in the plugin file.
1. Create an empty members page as a root for all member pages.
1. go back to wp-admin and find that members page and edit it
1. notice something like /wp-admin/post.php?post=420&action=edit in the URL bar in your browser
1. note that number after post=420
1. that number (420 in this example) is the value of the PMPROUP_PARENT_PAGE_ID that you need to manually edit in the pmpro-user-pages.php file.
